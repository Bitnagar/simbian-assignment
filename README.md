# Simbian's Frontend Developer Assignment - Shivam Bhatnagar

## Include a short README (1-2 paragraphs) describing

### Your thought process

I wanted to build something that could translate to various device widths. I wanted to keep the primary theme of receiving alerts and acting upon them. So built the 3 cards depicting the same. The content was extra so added another section in which `More from Simbian` is shown

Without/With Simbian section has its own summaries rendered after the heading. After that comes the cards. Summaries and Cards both have sequencing animations. First the animation for Without Simbian section takes place and then With Simbian animation follows.

After this section we have More with Simbian section which shows what more Simbian does.

All animations translates to different device widths.

Used Next.js 14, TailwindCSS and Framer Motion for animations.

**The requirements got updated 24 hours after I got the email from Lekhraj. So I had to continue building this due to time constraints.**

### Animation library used

Framer Motion

### Any known issues or improvements you would make with more time

No known Issues. I would like to build a more polished version for the mobile devices. Add Light mode support and do some adjustments.

DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT ANYWHERE ELSE.
