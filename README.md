# Simbian's Frontend Developer Assignment - Shivam Bhatnagar

## Include a short README (1-2 paragraphs) describing

### Your thought process

I wanted to build something that could translate to various device widths. I wanted to keep the primary theme of receiving alerts and acting upon them. So built the 3 cards depicting the same. The content was extra so added another section in which `More from Simbian` is shown

Used Next.js 14, TailwindCSS and Framer Motion for animations.

The requirements got updated 24 hours after I got the email from Lekhraj. So I had to continue building this due to time constraints. Kindly make sure to get the requirements correct before sending out the emails.

### Animation library used

Framer Motion

### Any known issues or improvements you would make with more time

No known Issues. I would like to build a more polished version. Add Light mode and dark mode support

DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT ANYWHERE ELSE.
